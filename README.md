Student Conversations Now was founded by a group of graduate and undergraduate students who are passionate about improving student health. Every student has their own story, but we often go through very similar experiences.

Students who are struggling often donâ€™t reach out. We would like to solve this problem by creating safe and inclusive student communities where students have access to resources, information, and support.
