# node-dandelion
A nodejs client for the Dandelion API.

Bring the powerful text analysis tools from Dandelion API to your NodeJs apps.

This client is a work in progress.

As of v1.0.0, the following endpoints of Dandelion API are featured:
- Text Similarity API: dandelion.txtSim(obj, callback)
- Entity Extraction API: dandelion.txtNex(obj, callback)
- Text Classification API: dandelion.txtCl(obj, callback)
- Language Detection API: dandelion.txtLi(obj, callback)

The POST endpoints are not implemented yet.
